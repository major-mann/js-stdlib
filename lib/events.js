//     5. Time Zone Database
//     ICU uses the public domain data and code derived from
//     Time Zone Database for its time zone support. The ownership of the TZ database is explained
//     in BCP 175: Procedure for Maintaining the Time Zone
//     Database section 7.

//     7.  Database Ownership

//        The TZ database itself is not an IETF Contribution or an IETF
//        document.  Rather it is a pre-existing and regularly updated work
//        that is in the public domain, and is intended to remain in the public
//        domain.  Therefore, BCPs 78 [RFC5378] and 79 [RFC3979] do not apply
//        to the TZ Database or contributions that individuals make to it.
//        Should any claims be made and substantiated against the TZ Database,
//        the organization that is providing the IANA Considerations defined in
//        this RFC, under the memorandum of understanding with the IETF,
//        currently ICANN, may act in accordance with all competent court
//        orders.  No ownership claims will be made by ICANN or the IETF Trust
//        on the database or the code.  Any person making a contribution to the
//        database or code waives all rights to future claims in that
//        contribution or in the TZ Database.

//     Copyright (c) 2000-2006, The Perl Foundation.

//     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
//     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

//     Preamble

//     This license establishes the terms under which a given free software
//     Package may be copied, modified, distributed, and/or redistributed.
//     The intent is that the Copyright Holder maintains some artistic
//     control over the development of that Package while still keeping the
//     Package available as open source and free software.

//     You are always permitted to make arrangements wholly outside of this
//     license directly with the Copyright Holder of a given Package.  If the
//     terms of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to
//     make of the Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek
//     a different licensing arrangement.

//     Definitions

//         "Copyright Holder" means the individual(s) or organization(s)
//         named in the copyright notice for the entire Package.

//         "Contributor" means any party that has contributed code or other
//         material to the Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder's
//         procedures.

//         "You" and "your" means any person who would like to copy,
//         distribute, or modify the Package.

//         "Package" means the collection of files distributed by the
//         Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection and/or of
//         those files. A given Package may consist of either the Standard
//         Version, or a Modified Version.

//         "Distribute" means providing a copy of the Package or making it
//         accessible to anyone else, or in the case of a company or
//         organization, to others outside of your company or organization.

//         "Distributor Fee" means any fee that you charge for Distributing
//         this Package or providing support for this Package to another
//         party.  It does not mean licensing fees.

//         "Standard Version" refers to the Package if it has not been
//         modified, or has been modified only in ways explicitly requested
//         by the Copyright Holder.

//         "Modified Version" means the Package, if it has been changed, and
//         such changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright
//         Holder.

//         "Original License" means this Artistic License as Distributed with
//         the Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as
//         it may be modified by The Perl Foundation in the future.

//         "Source" form means the source code, documentation source, and
//         configuration files for the Package.

//         "Compiled" form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary,
//         or any other form resulting from mechanical transformation or
//         translation of the Source form.

//     Permission for Use and Modification Without Distribution

//     (1)  You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use
//     Modified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that
//     you do not Distribute the Modified Version.

//     Permissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version

//     (2)  You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the
//     Standard Version of this Package in any medium without restriction,
//     either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate
//     all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.  At
//     your discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include a
//     Compiled form of the Package.

//     (3)  You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other
//     modifications made available from the Copyright Holder.  The resulting
//     Package will still be considered the Standard Version, and as such
//     will be subject to the Original License.

//     Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source

//     (4)  You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis
//     or for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the
//     Modified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs
//     from the Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting
//     any non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that
//     you do at least ONE of the following:

//         (a)  make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder
//         of the Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the
//         Copyright Holder may include your modifications in the Standard
//         Version.

//         (b)  ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not
//         prevent the user installing or running the Standard Version. In
//         addition, the Modified Version must bear a name that is different
//         from the name of the Standard Version.

//         (c)  allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to
//         make the Source form of the Modified Version available to others
//         under

//             (i)  the Original License or

//             (ii)  a license that permits the licensee to freely copy,
//             modify and redistribute the Modified Version using the same
//             licensing terms that apply to the copy that the licensee
//             received, and requires that the Source form of the Modified
//             Version, and of any works derived from it, be made freely
//             available in that license fees are prohibited but Distributor
//             Fees are allowed.

//     Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version
//     or Modified Versions without the Source

//     (5)  You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without
//     the Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to
//     get the Source of the Standard Version.  Such instructions must be
//     valid at the time of your distribution.  If these instructions, at any
//     time while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you
//     must provide new instructions on demand or cease further distribution.
//     If you provide valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty
//     days after you become aware that the instructions are invalid, then
//     you do not forfeit any of your rights under this license.

//     (6)  You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without
//     the Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to
//     the Source of the Modified Version.

//     Aggregating or Linking the Package

//     (7)  You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or
//     Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting
//     aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the
//     Package.  Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other
//     components in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license
//     apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions
//     as included in the aggregation.

//     (8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with
//     other works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to
//     build stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that
//     include the Package, and Distribute the result without restriction,
//     provided the result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.

//     Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version

//     (9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that
//     merely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause
//     the Package to be a Modified Version.  In addition, such works are not
//     considered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the
//     terms of this license.

//     General Provisions

//     (10)  Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or
//     Modified Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using,
//     modifying or distributing the Package, you accept this license. Do not
//     use, modify, or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this
//     license.

//     (11)  If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified
//     Version made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required
//     to ensure that your Modified Version complies with the requirements of
//     this license.

//     (12)  This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark,
//     service mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.

//     (13)  This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide,
//     free-of-charge patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell,
//     sell, import and otherwise transfer the Package with respect to any
//     patent claims licensable by the Copyright Holder that are necessarily
//     infringed by the Package. If you institute patent litigation
//     (including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against any party alleging
//     that the Package constitutes direct or contributory patent
//     infringement, then this Artistic License to you shall terminate on the
//     date that such litigation is filed.

//     (14)  Disclaimer of Warranty:
//     THE PACKAGE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER AND CONTRIBUTORS "AS
//     IS' AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES. THE IMPLIED
//     WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR
//     NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE DISCLAIMED TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY YOUR LOCAL
//     LAW. UNLESS REQUIRED BY LAW, NO COPYRIGHT HOLDER OR CONTRIBUTOR WILL
//     BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL
//     DAMAGES ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THE PACKAGE, EVEN IF
//     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.
